	<p><b>Sexual Health in America (2017)</b></p>
	<p><br>I worked on a couple of projects for school using the National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS), a nationally representative US questionnaire from 1992 that includes the highest response rates ever attained in a large survey for questions regarding sexual health and behaviours. The data is obviously very interesting and is, of course, to be taken with the whole container of salt. Unfortunately, the age range for the survey is 18-59, cutting off the period of greatest interest to the analysis. One project concerned the correlates and life course health trajectories of those who report being sexually touched as children, and the other concerns the prevalence of sexual dysfunctions by gender.</p>

	<p><br>Results for the sexual dysfunction project indicated that women have a higher average number of sexual dysfunctions than men but that this number decreases with age whereas it increases for men. Poor self-rated health, prepubertal sexual touching, and interference of sex due to stress are found to be important predictors of dysfunction in both men and women while other factors are observed to vary in importance and significance among men and women. Measures of socioeconomic status were largely insignificant. I am led to suspect that the prevalence of a female sexual dysfunction count follows a third-order polynomial relation, increasing into the twenties and then decreasing until late life where dysfunction occurs due to frailty, immobility, and other physiological reasons unlike men who have a clearly monotonic prevalence of dysfunction over time. While the descriptives don't lie (except they do for sensitive questions which are also subject to recall bias), my models have too many flaws to be taken seriously since issues of confounding aren't taken into account. My current research addresses this with respect to a slightly different topic. But feel free to talk to me if you want to know more about the information in the NHSLS or the methods I used here.</p>

	<li>If you would like to learn about the sexual habits of America, you may do so very easily by going <a href="https://popcenter.uchicago.edu/page/nhsls">here</a>. Sexual research seems to interest people and so I have used it as an opportunity to spark people's statistical imaginations. Just make sure you apply survey weights if you use the survey so that it is actually nationally representative. There are professionals who fail to do this.</li>
