<div class="death">

	<p>I was not going to make a website without including my favourite quotes about the death of the social self.</p>
	
	<ul class="list-unstyled">
	<li>When no man is obliged to put his powers at the disposal of another, and no one has any claim of right to substantial support from his fellow man, each is both independent and weakâ€¦his weakness make him feel the need for some outside help which he cannot expect from any of his fellows, for they are both impotent and cold. In this extremity he naturally turns his eyes toward that huge entity which alone stands out above the universal level of abasement. His needs, and even more his longings, continually put him in mind of that entity, and he ends by regarding it as the sole and necessary support of his individual weakness.</li>
	<li>- Tocqueville, requoted from Hall and Lindholm, 1999, p.81</li>
