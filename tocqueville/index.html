	<p>A French Aristocrat named Alexis de Tocqueville travelled to America in the middle of the 19th century to study the American prison system and became side-tracked after witnessing American political culture firsthand. These Americans had a strange habit of joining together in groups with strangers to accomplish shared aims. This was not the case in France and England at the time where it was often impossible to form organizations without being in a position of power and privilege. Tocqueville was unaware that he was witnessing a legal revolution as organizational tools became diffused among the masses, including the right to access the form of the general incorporation. This period is now being recognized as the dawn of the open access society and Tocqueville had sensed it as a "rising tide of equality" which would begin to wash over the world. Tocqueville's greatest admiration of America was directed at the federal structure of their society and the effects he saw it having on American mores. Decentralization compensated for the country's unimpressive laws by fostering a positive social condition in America - the democratization of nearly everything. With a habit of local self-government, the Americans could prevent themselves from becoming a lost and anonymous mass through being constantly brought together to work toward the common good. Moreover, since the Americans were used to joining in teams to garner collective thrust in the pursuit of their own ends, the individual was weak, powerless, and driven toward prosociality to look after <b>himself</b>. Access to forming corporations and a plethora of voluntary associations reinforced the virtues of the American political and economic system and group power served as a check against despotism while at the same time providing the basis for trust in society that would ensure that Americans continued to look out for each other and behave in moral terms. Driven to provide for each other out of the need for each other's esteem, the "social self" was alive and well in the American psyche.</p>
	<p><br>Fast forward almost 200 years and we are taking annual extracts of people's blood, saliva, and collecting other biomeasures so that we can ask them a bunch of questions about their lives and how they are feeling and thenâ€¦correlate stuff. I promise this has to do with Tocqueville, but first meet the longitudinal survey and enter the sociology of health where we tell you about how and why the disadvantaged have poor health. Selection effects and issues of not knowing what's causing what are everywhere when doing this research. Such cases are obvious with respect to social and psychological measures, but now we don't even know whether chronic stress causes low-grade inflammation or if low-grade inflammation causes chronic stress. We had hoped that the biologists knew what they were doing because we know the social scientists don't. These studies also use many scales and indices for social and psychological measures that lump together some of the things we might want to disentangle. One instance of this problem occurs with respect to "socioeconomic status" which typically combines one's education level and income to tell us something about the social resources that a person commands. But being able to afford expensive care and medical assistance is a very different buffer to poor health than is having knowledge and prestige to bolster your health, despite the co-occurrence and expected causal relation that exists among the two factors.</p>
	<p><br>I am writing two papers. The first is an empirical paper which uses a causal modeling technique known as marginal structural modeling in order to examine the differential roles that income and social engagement play in the production of health over the life course. If Tocqueville was right, there should be feedback between social, psychological, and economic variables which will be particularly important to look at before, during, and after life transitions. We would also predict that measures of collective efficacy, religious involvement, and the like would reflect positively on health measures, but how do these social connections differ in their returns to health from other connections? It is possible that there is a trade-off to be made in the allocation of time, care, and other resources that leaves a certain level of diversification in one's relational portfolio as maximally efficient for producing good health in late life. The second paper is a theoretical paper which takes Tocqueville as a starting point and goes deeper into ideas in political economy about the dynamics of capitalist societies to motivate the idea that creative destruction may be viewed as a social condition in late modernity. I take no normative stance here, but illustrate the idea as highly useful for guiding research in the social scientific study of health.</p>

	<p><br>With two longitudinal Canadian health surveys cross-linked to tax returns, I am employing a causal modeling technique called marginal structural modeling which uses inverse probability weighting to examine causal effects with observational data to study the relationship between income composition and health status over the life course.</p>
	<p><br>I previously checked a "monotonicity hypothesis" whereby constant increases in one's income were expected to be linked to superior self-rated health. The findings were null.</p>
	<p><br>I am currently investigating whether income volatility can be linked to deteriorations in health, why there is massive volatility in the effective tax rate of the lowest decile of taxpayers, and whether there exists such a thing as an optimally diversified health portfolio when considering socio-economic inputs such as income, education, social support, organizational involvement.</p>
