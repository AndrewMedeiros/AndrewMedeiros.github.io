	<p><b>Physician Migration (2016)</b></p>
		<p><br>I worked with Professor David Wright (McGill history) at the Institute for Health and Social Policy in 2016 on a part of a project looking at several waves of physician immigration to Canada after WWII. Doctors are a source of scarce human capital in many developing countries and their movement is poorly understood. Fortunately, countries like Canada have been keeping track of the intended occupation and country of origin of their immigrants for a long time. Moreover, almost all Canadian physicians are registered in an annually published medical directory that we can exhaust in order to find the current location of doctors and the schools where they were trained. Looking specifically at South Africa, we made a dataset containing information on every South African-trained doctor in Canada for semi-census years to fit the immigration patterns of South African physicians with broader trends of immigration after WWII while tracking their subsequent movements in Canada. We then called up the ones who aren't dead (and went through the obituaries of the others) to interview them and put the narratives of their movements in comparative perspective with other countries for which similar methods are being applied. Our study also helps to answer some questions about the changes to the Canadian immigration system which followed WWII.</p>
		
		<p><br>Here is some of what I learned:</p>
		<p>1. The system of South African stratification wasn't soâ€¦black and white. Afrikaners tended to sit above British South Africans in the social hierarchy, Japanese people were accorded white status since they were usually there to conduct business despite there being unfavourable views toward other Asian groups, and Jews were not treated as well as the Afrikaners and Brits. Many of the physicians choosing to migrate to Canada were Jewish. In fact, hardly any migrants to Canada were trained at the Black medical schools because South African laws often prevented them from leaving the country during certain years of Apartheid.</p>
		<p>2. Those who fled tended not to bring their parents with them. Freedom of movement can be a positive liberty for some, but has negative consequences for others whose social bonds are broken by the fleeing of those who they depend on. Some choose not to migrate because they do not wish to leave others behind. Perhaps others left grandpa and grandma to die alone and cold.</p>
		<p>3. Most doctors tended to move to Ontario and cluster with any friends or family who were already in Canada. Jewish communities often stayed together, particularly in Toronto.</p>
