<div class="biosociology">

	<p>I am currently working at McGill's Centre for Intellectual Property Policy (CIPP) for Professor Richard Gold (McGill law, genetics) on a few empirical projects concerning intellectual property and innovation.</p>

		<p><b>1. Attitudes toward Open Science</b></p>
		<li>Through interviews and a survey with global reach, we are going to see how life science researchers in different regions understand and feel about different aspects of open science and intellectual property. This evidence may help to guide and improve upon the future of open science, an emerging norm, and highlight the correlates of those who see open science as a positive or negative development.</li>

		<p><b>2. Intellectual Property Index</b></p>
		<li>We are coding the features of IP regimes across the globe over a large time period to provide a novel index that can be used by researchers to answer a variety of questions concerning intellectual property. The index will be particularly valuable for answering questions about the relation between intellectual property and economic development on which the previous literature is divided.</li>

		<p><b>3. Canadian Patent Litigation Database</b></p>
		<li>We are coding every patent battle in Canada over a large period of time in order to see the evolution of trends in Canadian patent litigation. In addition to having the correlates of victories and defeats, we may be better able to understand how changing precedents alter the course of patent litigation through time.</li>
